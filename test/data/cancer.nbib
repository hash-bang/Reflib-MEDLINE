TI  - Prognostic value of preoperative von Willebrand factor plasma levels in patients 
      with Glioblastoma.
LID - 10.1002/cam4.747 [doi]
AB  - Circulating biomarker for malignant gliomas could improve both differential
      diagnosis and clinical management of brain tumor patients. Among all gliomas,
      glioblastoma (GBM) is considered the most hypervascularized tumor with activation
      of multiple proangiogenic signaling pathways that enhance tumor growth. To
      investigate whether preoperative antigen plasma level of von Willebrand Factor
      (VWF:Ag) might be possible marker for GBM onset, progression, and prognosis, we
      retrospectively examined 57 patients with histological diagnosis for GBM and 23
      meningiomas (MNGs), benign intracranial expansive lesions, enrolled as controls. 
      Blood samples were collected from all the patients before tumor resection. Plasma
      von Willebrand Factor (VWF):Ag levels were determined by using a latex
      particle-enhanced immunoturbidimetric assay. The median levels of vWF:Ag were
      significantly higher in GBMs than in meningiomas (MNGs) (183 vs. 133 IU/dL, P =
      0.01). The cumulative 1-year survival was significantly shorter in patients with 
      VWF:Ag levels >200 IU/dL than in those with levels <200 IU/dL and increased VWF
      levels were associated with a threefold higher risk of death in GBM patients. Our
      data suggest that VWF:Ag could be a circulating biomarker of disease malignancy, 
      that could be considered, in association with other genetic and epigenetic
      factors, currently available in the GBM management. Future studies should
      investigate whether plasma VWF:Ag levels could also be used to monitor
      therapeutic effects and whether it may have a prognostic value.

TI  - Evaluating the influence of prophylactic central neck dissection on TNM staging
      and the recurrence risk stratification of cN differentiated thyroid carcinoma.
LID - S0007-4551(16)30041-8 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.bulcan.2016.04.003 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to explore the risk factors that were
      associated with central lymph node metastasis (CLNM) in patients with clinical
      nodal negative differentiated thyroid carcinoma (cN0 DTC) after prophylactic
      central neck dissection (pCND). The influence of pCND on TNM staging and
      recurrence risk stratification (RRS) in patients with cN0 DTC was also evaluated 
      in our study. METHODS: A total of 153 cN0 DTC patients in Guangdong general
      hospital who underwent thyroidectomy with pCND from March 2014 to October 2014
      were enrolled in this study. The relations of CLNM with clinicopathologic
      characteristics of cN0 DTC were analyzed by univariate and multivariate logistic 
      regression. The influence of pCND on migration of TNM staging and RRS in cN0 DTC 
      was observed. RESULTS: In the present study, CLNM was found in 42.5% (65 of 153
      cases) of patients with cN0 DTC. On univariate analysis, the age less than 45
      years old, tumor size more than 2cm, pT staging, and a total number of central
      lymph nodes dissected more than 3 were significantly associated with CLNM
      (P<0.05); however, gender, tumors affecting both lobes, multifocality, capsular
      invasion, and Hashimoto's thyroiditis were not related with CLNM (P>0.05). On
      multivariate logistic regression, age<45 years (P=0.001) and a total number of
      central lymph nodes dissected >3 (P=0.002) were significantly associated with
      CLNM. Because of the identification of CLNM in the implementation of pCND, 15
      (9.8%) of 153 cN0 DTC patients were upgraded in TNM staging; all these patients
      were older than 45 years. Fifty-six patients (36.6%) developed higher RRS (from
      low to intermediate) after pCND. CONCLUSIONS: For younger patients (age<45
      years), careful preoperative assessment of the lymph node status must be done;
      surgeons should consider this risk factor when deciding whether to perform pCND. 
      Thorough lymphadenectomy in the implementation of pCND can avoid residual lymph
      node metastasis and help to increase the incidence of CLNM. pCND can indentify
      occult CLNM which allows more precise TNM staging (for patients with age>/=45
      years) and RRS.

AB  - Dual targeting towards both extracellular and intracellular receptors specific to
      tumor is a significant approach for cancer diagnosis and therapy. In the present 
      study, a novel nano-platform (AuNC-cRGD-Apt) with dual targeting function was
      initially established by conjugating gold nanocluster (AuNC) with cyclic RGD
      (cRGD) that is specific to alphavbeta3integrins over-expressed on the surface of 
      tumor tissues and aptamer AS1411 (Apt) that is of high affinity to nucleolin
      over-expressed in the cytoplasm and nucleus of tumor cells. Then, AuNC-cRGD-Apt
      was further functionalized with near infrared (NIR) fluorescence dye (MPA),
      giving a NIR fluorescent dual-targeting probe AuNC-MPA-cRGD-Apt.
      AuNC-MPA-cRGD-Apt displays low cytotoxicity and favorable tumor-targeting
      capability at both in vitro and in vivo level, suggesting its clinical potential 
      for tumor imaging. Additionally, Doxorubicin (DOX), a widely used clinical
      chemotherapeutic drug that kill cancer cells by intercalating DNA in cellular
      nucleus, was immobilized onto AuNC-cRGD-Apt forming a pro-drug,
      AuNC-DOX-cRGD-Apt. The enhanced tumor affinity, deep tumor penetration and
      improved anti-tumor activity of this pro-drug were demonstrated in different
      tumor cell lines, tumor spheroid and tumor-bearing mouse models. Results in this 
      study suggest not only the prospect of non-toxic AuNC modified with two targeting
      ligands for tumor targeted imaging, but also confirm the promising future of dual
      targeting AuNC as a core for the design of prodrug in the field of cancer
      therapy.

TI  - Inhibition of p90 ribosomal S6 kinase attenuates cell migration and proliferation
      of the human lung adenocarcinoma through phospho-GSK-3beta and osteopontin.
AB  - p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (p90RSK) constitutes a family of serine/threonine kinases
      that have been shown to be involved in cell proliferation of various malignancies
      via direct or indirect effects on the cell-cycle machinery. We investigated the
      role of p90RSK in lung adenocarcinomas and whether the inhibition of p90RSK
      diminishes cancer progression. Moreover, we investigated the involvement of
      glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) and osteopontin (OPN) in the
      p90RSK-induced lung adenocarcinoma progression. p90RSK, OPN, and GSK-3beta
      protein expressions were examined in the A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cell line
      in the presence and absence of BI-D1870 (BID), a p90RSK inhibitor. Gene
      expression of anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic markers namely Bcl2 and Bax,
      respectively, were studied by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. In
      addition, the A549 lung adenocarcinoma cell line was characterized for cell
      proliferation using the MTT assay and cell migration using the scratch migration 
      assay. Our study revealed that total RSK1 protein expression is over expressed in
      the A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cell line, an effect which is significantly
      reduced upon pretreatment with BID (69.32 +/- 12.41 % of control; P < 0.05). The 
      inhibition of p90RSK also showed a significant suppression of cell proliferation 
      (54.3 +/- 6.73 % of control; P < 0.01) and cell migration (187.90 +/- 16.10 % of 
      control; P < 0.01). Treatment of the A549 cells with BID regressed the expression
      of Bcl2 mRNA (56.92 +/- 6.07 % of control; P < 0.01). BID also regressed protein 
      expression of OPN (79.57 +/- 5.32 % of control; P < 0.05) and phospho-GSK-3beta
      (73.04 +/- 8.95 % of control; P < 0.05). The p90RSK has an essential role in
      promoting tumor growth and proliferation in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
      BID may serve as an alternative cancer treatment in NSCLC.

TI  - Factors associated with quality of life of caregivers of Mexican cancer patients.
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate factors associated with a poor quality of life (QoL) of
      caregivers of Mexican cancer patients. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a
      cross-sectional survey of 826 primary caregivers of adult cancer patients at the 
      Oncology Hospital of the Mexican Institute of Social Security. Dependent
      variables were physical composite score (PCS) and mental composite score (MCS) of
      QoL of caregivers measured by the Short Form (SF-12) of Medical Outcomes Survey
      questionnaire. Independent variables included general characteristics of the
      caregivers, their unmet needs, caregiving and characteristics of cancer patients.
      Multiple linear regression analysis for each QoL composite score was carried out.
      RESULTS: The average PCS was 48.7 and MCS was 47.1. Lower PCS was associated with
      older age, symptoms of chronic illness, depression and unmet personal needs,
      while concerns about the future were associated with higher physical QoL. Lower
      MCS was associated with anxiety, depression, unmet personal and emotional needs, 
      and surgery in the last month. Caring for patients with a high global health
      status was associated with a higher MCS. CONCLUSION: Information about
      caregivers' QoL and its associated factors is important in order to identify and 
      address modifiable factors. Also, studies from different cultures like Mexico are
      essential in order to identify possible generalities and particularities in QoL
      and its associated factors. Given the limitations of the cross-sectional design
      of our study, future longitudinal studies on the changes of Mexican caregivers'
      quality of life and their determinants will be an important step to further
      understanding these phenomena.

TI  - Comparison of visibility of circumscribed masses on Digital Breast Tomosynthesis 
      (DBT) and 2D mammography: are circumscribed masses better visualized and assured 
      of being benign on DBT?
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the visibility of circumscribed masses on digital breast
      tomosynthesis (DBT) images and 2D mammograms and determine the usefulness of DBT 
      for differentiation between benign and malignant circumscribed masses. METHODS:
      Seventy-one (19 malignant and 52 benign) mammographic well-circumscribed masses
      were included. Visibility of the masses and halo signs on DBT images were
      retrospectively compared with 2D mammograms. The effects of mammographic breast
      density on mass visibility were also evaluated. RESULTS: For DBT, 83% were
      superior and 17% were equivalent in visibility of the masses to that of 2D, and
      superiority of DBT was significantly enhanced in the high breast density group
      compared with the low breast density group (91% vs 68%, respectively, p = 0.016).
      Three lesions were only detected on DBT. There was no significant difference in
      the superiority of DBT for lesion visibility between malignant and benign masses.
      The halo sign was detected in 58% lesions on DBT and in 4% on 2D (p < 0.001).
      CONCLUSION: Circumscribed masses were better visualized on DBT than on 2D
      mammograms, particularly in high-density breasts. The halo sign often appeared on
      DBT and gave a clearer mass margin. However, circumscribed masses on DBT are not 
      assured of being benign. KEY POINTS: * Circumscribed masses were better
      visualized on breast tomosynthesis than on 2D mammography. * Tomosynthesis
      visualized circumscribed masses better than 2D for all breast density categories.
      * Halo signs often appeared on tomosynthesis and contributed to detect
      circumscribed margins. * Circumscribed masses on tomosynthesis images are not
      assured of being benign lesions.

AB  - Autologous T lymphocytes genetically modified to express T cell receptors or
      chimeric antigen receptors have shown great promise in the treatment of several
      cancers, including melanoma and leukemia. In addition to tumor-associated
      antigens and tumor-specific neoantigens, tumors expressing viral peptides can
      also be recognized by specific T cells and are attractive targets for cell
      therapy. Hepatocellular carcinoma cells often have hepatitis B virus DNA
      integration and can be targeted by hepatitis B virus-specific T cells. Here, we
      describe a method to engineer hepatitis B virus-specific T cell receptors in
      primary human T lymphocytes based on electroporation of hepatitis B virus T cell 
      receptor messenger RNA. This method can be extended to a large scale therapeutic 
      T cell production following current good manufacturing practice compliance and is
      applicable to the redirection of T lymphocytes with T cell receptors of other
      virus specificities such as Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and chimeric
      receptors specific for other antigens expressed on cancer cells.

AB  - The immune system is a crucial player in the development of cancer. Once it is in
      imbalance and immunosuppressive mechanisms supporting tumor growth take over
      control, dendritic cell immunotherapy might offer a solution to restore the
      balance. There are several methods to manufacture dendritic cells but none of
      them has yet proven to be superior to others. In this chapter, we discuss the
      methodology using electroporation of mRNA encoding Wilms' tumor gene 1, survivin,
      and TriMix (mixture of caTLR4, CD40L, and CD70) to simultaneously load and mature
      dendritic cells.

AB  - Adoptive T-cell therapy based on the infusion of patient's own immune cells after
      ex vivo culturing is among the most potent forms of personalized treatment among 
      recent clinical developments for the treatment of cancer. However, despite high
      rates of successful initial clinical responses, only about 20 % of patients with 
      metastatic melanoma treated with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) enter
      complete and long-term regression, with the majority either relapsing after
      initial partial regression or not benefiting at all. Previous studies have shown 
      a positive correlation between the number infused T cells migrating to the tumor 
      and the clinical response, but also that only a small fraction of adoptively
      transferred T cells reach the tumor site. In this chapter, we describe a protocol
      for transfection of TILs with mRNA encoding the chemokine receptor CXCR2
      transiently redirecting and improving TILs migration toward tumor-secreted
      chemokines in vitro.

AB  - Dendritic cells are known to be the most potent antigen presenting cell in the
      immune system and are used as cellular adjuvants in therapeutic anticancer
      vaccines using various tumor-associated antigens or their derivatives. One way of
      loading antigen into the dendritic cells is by mRNA electroporation, ensuring
      presentation of antigen through major histocompatibility complex I and
      potentially activating T cells, enabling them to kill the tumor cells. Despite
      extensive research in the field, only one dendritic cell-based vaccine has been
      approved. There is therefore a great need to elucidate and understand the
      immunological impact of dendritic cell vaccination in order to improve clinical
      benefit. In this chapter, we describe a method for performing immune monitoring
      using peripheral blood mononuclear cells and autologous dendritic cells
      transfected with tumor-associated antigen-encoding mRNA.

AB  - Dendritic cell (DC)-based vaccines are commonly used for cancer immunotherapy. To
      prepare vaccines, DCs are pulsed or transfected with either: (a) defined peptides
      of tumor-associated antigens, (b) total protein isolated from the tumor cell, (c)
      autologous total RNA isolated from the tumor cell, (d) synthetic
      tumor-antigen-encoding mRNA, or (e) genes that encode for specific
      tumor-associated antigens. Introduction of tumor-associated antigen(s) and
      subsequent generation of mature DCs that can stimulate tumor-antigen-specific
      cytotoxic T lymphocytes comprise the critical steps of cancer vaccine
      preparation. Here, we described a method of: (a) preparing and delivering
      synthetic FOXP3 mRNA into human DCs, (b) generating mature DCs,
CI  - (c) generating FOXP3-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and (d) evaluating
      cytotoxicity of FOXP3-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes against inflammatory
      breast cancer cells.

AB  - Intranodal immunization with antigen-encoding naked mRNA has proven to be an
      efficacious and safe approach to induce antitumor immunity. Thanks to its unique 
      characteristics, mRNA can act not only as a source for antigen but also as an
      adjuvant for activation of the immune system. The search for additional adjuvants
      that can be combined with mRNA to further improve the potency of the immunization
      revealed Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) ligand as a potent candidate. Systemic
      administration of the dendritic cell-activating FLT3 ligand prior to or along
      with mRNA immunization-enhanced priming and expansion of antigen-specific CD8(+) 
      T cells in lymphoid organs, T-cell homing into melanoma tumors, and therapeutic
      activity of the intranodally administered mRNA. Both compounds demonstrate a
      successful combination in terms of boosting the immune response. This chapter
      describes methods for intranodal immunization with naked mRNA by
      co-administration of FLT3 ligand, which leads to strong synergistic effects.

AB  - Electroporation is well established for transient mRNA transfection of many
      mammalian cells, including immune cells such as dendritic cells used in cancer
      immunotherapy. Therapeutic application requires methods to efficiently
      electroporate and transfect millions of immune cells in a fast process with high 
      cell survival. Continuous flow of suspended dendritic cells through a channel
      incorporating spatially separated microporous meshes with a synchronized
      electrical pulsing sequence can yield dendritic cell transfection rates of >75 % 
      with survival rates of >90 %. This chapter describes the instrumentation and
      methods needed for the efficient transfection by electroporation of millions of
      dendritic cells in one continuous flow process.

AB  - mRNA-electroporated dendritic cells (DC) are demonstrating clinical benefit in
      patients in many therapeutic areas, including cancer and infectious diseases.
      According to current good manufacturing guidelines, cell-based medicinal products
      have to be defined for identity, purity, potency, stability, and viability. In
      order to comply with the directives and guidelines defined by the regulatory
      authorities, we report here a standardized and reproducible method for the
      manufacturing of clinical-grade mRNA-transfected DC.

AB  - Dendritic cells (DCs) are the orchestrators of the immune system and are
      frequently used in clinical trials in order to boost the immune system in cancer 
      patients. Among several available techniques for DC modification, mRNA
      electroporation is an interesting technique due to the favorable characteristics 
      of mRNA. Antigen expression level and duration can be increased by multiple
      optimizations of an antigen-encoding mRNA template. Here, we describe different
      molecular modifications to a WT1-encoding mRNA construct in order to increase
      antigen expression and the subsequent introduction of mRNA into DCs.

AB  - Recent advances have made it possible to synthesize mRNA in vitro that is
      relatively stable when introduced into mammalian cells, has a diminished ability 
      to activate the innate immune response against exogenous (virus-like) RNA, and
      can be efficiently translated into protein. Synthetic methods have also been
      developed to produce mRNA with unique investigational properties such as
      photo-cross-linking, fluorescence emission, and attachment of ligands through
      click chemistry. Synthetic mRNA has been proven effective in numerous
      applications beneficial for human health such as immunizing patients against
      cancer and infections diseases, alleviating diseases by restoring deficient
      proteins, converting somatic cells to pluripotent stem cells to use in
      regenerative medicine therapies, and engineering the genome by making specific
      alterations in DNA. This introductory chapter provides background information
      relevant to the following 20 chapters of this volume that present protocols for
      these applications of synthetic mRNA.

TI  - Overall Survival Analysis From a Randomized Phase II Study of Axitinib With or
      Without Dose Titration in First-Line Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma.
LID - S1558-7673(16)30095-7 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.clgc.2016.04.005 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In a randomized phase II trial in metastatic renal cell carcinoma
      (mRCC), objective response rate was significantly higher with axitinib versus
      placebo titration (54% vs. 34%; 1-sided P = .019). PATIENTS AND METHODS:
      Treatment-naive patients with mRCC (n = 213) received axitinib 5 mg twice per day
      (b.i.d.) for 4 weeks. Patients meeting dose titration criteria were randomized to
      receive axitinib 5 mg b.i.d. with axitinib or placebo titration (n = 56 each); 91
      patients ineligible for randomization continued axitinib 5 mg b.i.d.; 10
      discontinued before randomization. RESULTS: Median overall survival (95%
      confidence interval [CI]) was 42.7 months (24.7-not estimable) with axitinib
      titration versus 30.4 months (23.7-45.0) with placebo titration (stratified
      hazard ratio, 0.785; 95% CI, 0.485-1.272; 1-sided P = .162), and 41.6 months (95%
      CI, 33.0-not estimable) in nonrandomized patients. Safety data were consistent
      with previous reports. CONCLUSION: Median overall survival was numerically longer
      in patients with first-line mRCC who received axitinib versus placebo titration. 
      No new safety signal was observed after long-term axitinib treatment in
      first-line mRCC.

TI  - Using Interferon Alfa Before Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors May Increase Survival in 
      Patients With Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma: A Turkish Oncology Group (TOG)
      Study.
LID - S1558-7673(16)30111-2 [pii]

AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to investigate the outcomes of interferon alfa and
      sequencing tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in patients with metastatic renal
      cell carcinoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This multicenter study assessing the
      efficacy of TKIs after interferon alfa therapy in the first-line setting in
      patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Patients (n = 104) from 8 centers 
      in Turkey, who had been treated with interferon alfa in the first-line setting,
      were included in the study. Prognostic factors were evaluated for
      progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 57
      years. The median PFS of the patients treated with interferon alfa in the
      first-line was 3.6 months. A total of 61 patients received TKIs (sunitinib, n =
      58; sorafenib, n = 3) after progression while on interferon alfa. The median PFS 
      among the TKI-treated patients was 13.2 months. In the univariate analysis for
      interferon alfa treatment, neutrophil and hemoglobin level, platelet count, and
      Karnofsky performance status were the significant factors associated with PFS. In
      the univariate analysis for TKI treatment, neutrophil and hemoglobin levels were 
      the significant factors for PFS. The median total PFS of the patients who had
      been treated with first-line interferon alfa and second-line TKIs was 24.9
      months. CONCLUSION: This study showed that first-line interferon alfa treatment
      before TKIs may improve the total PFS in patients with metastatic renal cell
      carcinoma.

TI  - Are the Formulas Used to Estimate Renal Function Adequate for Patients Treated
      With Cisplatin-Based Chemotherapy After Nephroureterectomy for Upper Tract
      Urothelial Carcinoma?
LID - S1558-7673(16)30108-2 [pii]

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The relationship between endogenous creatinine clearance (eCrCl) and
      renal function values obtained using mathematical formulas has not yet been fully
      elucidated, especially in patients with upper tract urothelial carcinoma that are
      treated with radical nephroureterectomy followed by cisplatin-based chemotherapy.
      METHODS: Sixty patients who received cisplatin-based chemotherapy for locally
      advanced or metastatic upper tract urothelial carcinoma after radical
      nephroureterectomy between 2000 and 2012 were retrospectively identified. eCrCl
      was measured based on 24-hour urine specimens obtained immediately prior to each 
      cycle of chemotherapy. Renal function was estimated with 4 different formulas:
      the Cockcroft-Gault, Modification of Diet in Renal Disease, Chronic Kidney
      Disease Epidemiology Collaboration, and Wright formulas. We evaluated the
      relationship between eCrCl and the renal function values obtained with each
      formula using the Pearson correlation coefficient and kappa statistics. RESULTS: 
      The median eCrCl was 53.9 mL/min. The Pearson correlation coefficients and kappa 
      statistics for the relationships between eCrCl and the renal function values
      obtained with each of the mathematical formulas ranged from 0.600 to 0.763 and
      from 0.29 to 0.67, respectively. Among the patients with eCrCl of >/= 60 mL/min, 
      70%, 60%, 50%, and 20% were estimated to have the renal function values of < 60
      mL/min by the Cockcroft-Gault, Modification of Diet in Renal Disease, Chronic
      Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration, and Wright formulas, respectively.
      CONCLUSIONS: All 4 of the tested formulas underestimated eCrCl. The values
      obtained with the Wright formula were most closely associated with eCrCl.

AB  - An alpha-lactalbumin-oleic acid (alpha-LA-OA) complex has exhibited selective
      antitumor activity in animal models and clinical trials. Although apoptosis and
      autophagy are activated and the functions of several organelles are disrupted in 
      response to alpha-LA-OA, the detailed antitumor mechanism remains unclear. In
      this study, we used a novel technique, isobaric tags for relative and absolute
      quantitation, to analyze the proteome of tumor cells treated with alpha-LA-OA. We
      identified 112 differentially expressed proteins: 95 were upregulated to satisfy 
      the metabolism of tumor cells; 17 were downregulated and targets of alpha-LA-OA. 
      According to the differentially expressed proteins, alpha-LA-OA exerted its
      antitumor activity by disrupting cytoskeleton stability and cell motility, and by
      inhibiting DNA, lipid, and adenosine triphosphate synthesis, leading to cellular 
      stress and activation of programmed cell death. This study provides a systematic 
      evaluation of the antitumor activity of alpha-LA-OA, identifying its interacting 
      targets and establishing the theoretical basis of alpha-LA-OA for use in cancer
      therapy.
