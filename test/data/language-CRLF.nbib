TI  - Domain-general mechanisms of complex working memory span.

LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.07.067 [doi]
AB  - A new fMRI complex working memory span paradigm was used to identify brain regions 
      making domain-general contributions to working memory task performance. For both 
      verbal and spatial versions of the task, complex working memory span performance 
      increased the activity in lateral prefrontal, anterior cingulate, and parietal 
      cortices during the Encoding, Maintenance, and Coordination phase of task 
      performance. Meanwhile, overlapping activity in anterior prefrontal and medial 
      temporal lobe regions was associated with both verbal and spatial recall from 
      working memory. These findings help to adjudicate several contested issues regarding 
      the executive mechanisms of working memory, the separability of short-term and 
      working memory in the verbal and spatial domains, and the relative contribution of 
      short-term and long-term memory mechanisms to working memory capacity. The study 
      also provides a vital bridge between psychometric and neuroimaging approaches to 
      working memory, and constrains our understanding of how working memory may 
      contribute to the broader landscape of cognitive performance.

TI  - How Auditory Experience Differentially Influences the Function of Left and Right 
      Superior Temporal Cortices.
PG  - 9564-9573
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0846-17.2017 [doi]
AB  - To investigate how hearing status, sign language experience, and task demands 
      influence functional responses in the human superior temporal cortices (STC) we 
      collected fMRI data from deaf and hearing participants (male and female), who either 
      acquired sign language early or late in life. Our stimuli in all tasks were pictures 
      of objects. We varied the linguistic and visuospatial processing demands in three 
      different tasks that involved decisions about (1) the sublexical (phonological) 
      structure of the British Sign Language (BSL) signs for the objects, (2) the semantic 
      category of the objects, and (3) the physical features of the objects.Neuroimaging 
      data revealed that in participants who were deaf from birth, STC showed increased 
      activation during visual processing tasks. Importantly, this differed across 
      hemispheres. Right STC was consistently activated regardless of the task whereas 
      left STC was sensitive to task demands. Significant activation was detected in the 
      left STC only for the BSL phonological task. This task, we argue, placed greater 
      demands on visuospatial processing than the other two tasks. In hearing signers, 
      enhanced activation was absent in both left and right STC during all three tasks. 
      Lateralization analyses demonstrated that the effect of deafness was more 
      task-dependent in the left than the right STC whereas it was more task-independent 
      in the right than the left STC. These findings indicate how the absence of auditory 
      input from birth leads to dissociable and altered functions of left and right STC in 
      deaf participants.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Those born deaf can offer unique insights 
      into neuroplasticity, in particular in regions of superior temporal cortex (STC) 
      that primarily respond to auditory input in hearing people. Here we demonstrate that 
      in those deaf from birth the left and the right STC have altered and dissociable 
      functions. The right STC was activated regardless of demands on visual processing. 
      In contrast, the left STC was sensitive to the demands of visuospatial processing. 
      Furthermore, hearing signers, with the same sign language experience as the deaf 
      participants, did not activate the STCs. Our data advance current understanding of 
      neural plasticity by determining the differential effects that hearing status and 
      task demands can have on left and right STC function.

TI  - Functional cerebral lateralization and dual-task efficiency-testing the function of 
      human brain lateralization using fTCD.
PG  - 293-301
LID - 10.1016/j.bbr.2010.10.029 [doi]
AB  - It has been hypothesized that functional cerebral lateralization enhances cognitive 
      performance. Evidence was found in birds and fish. Our study aimed to test this 
      hypothesis by analyzing the relationship between cerebral lateralization and both 
      single-task performance and dual-task efficiency in humans. We combined a dynamic 
      Landmark task which is assumed to be primarily processed in the right hemisphere and 
      a frequently used word generation task which is assumed to be primarily processed in 
      the left hemisphere. For each task individual strength and direction of hemispheric 
      lateralization was assessed using functional transcranial Doppler sonography (fTCD). 
      For each subject (15 women, 11 men), performance was measured in the two 
      single-tasks and in the dual-task condition. Performance was not related to strength 
      or direction of lateralization in single-tasks. With regard to dual-task efficiency, 
      we found the expected advantage of having a typical lateralization pattern. 
      Moreover, the results showed a slight negative, rather than a positive, relationship 
      between strength of lateralization and dual-task efficiency. Further analysis showed 
      that this negative relationship may only be present in subjects showing 
      non-significant lateralization for one or both tasks. Therefore, the hypothesis that 
      cerebral lateralization enhances human cognitive performance is too general: having 
      two functions significantly lateralized to different hemispheres enhances dual-task 
      efficiency, in this group strength of lateralized does not matter. However, if one 
      or both functions are not significantly lateralized overall performance is worse and 
      in this group, performance is negatively related to increased strength of 
      lateralization.

PG  - 219-27

AB  - The Simon effect consists of a faster and a more accurate performance when spatial 
      responses correspond to irrelevant-spatial stimuli than when they do not. The time 
      course of the Simon effect was investigated using centrally presented conventional 
      signals (arrows and spatial words) conveying spatial information through 
      iconic-symbolic (Experiments 1 and 2) and semantic (Experiment 3) codes. 
      Time-demanding object-inherent and semantic spatial codes were generated for arrows 
      and words, respectively. This resulted in Simon effects increasing in size across 
      increasing response times (RTs). However, different onsets of the Simon effect were 
      displayed across RT distributions. For arrows, the Simon effect was already 
      significant at the fastest RT intervals, providing clear evidence that they are 
      distinctively more effective directional indicators compared to words.

TI  - The mental representation of ordinal sequences is spatially organized.
PG  - B87-95
AB  - In the domain of numbers the existence of spatial components in the representation 
      of numerical magnitude has been convincingly demonstrated by an association between 
      number magnitude and response preference with faster left- than right-hand responses 
      for small numbers and faster right- than left-hand responses for large numbers 
      (Dehaene, S., Bossini, S., & Giraux, P. (1993) The mental representation of parity 
      and number magnitude. Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 122, 371-396). 
      Because numbers convey not only real or integer meaning but also ordinal meaning, 
      the question of whether non-numerical ordinal information is spatially coded 
      naturally follows. While previous research failed to show an association between 
      ordinal position and spatial response preference, we present two experiments 
      involving months (Experiment 1) and letters (Experiment 2) in which spatial coding 
      is demonstrated. Furthermore, the response-side effect was obtained with two 
      different stimulus-response mappings. The association occurred both when ordinal 
      information was relevant and when it was irrelevant to the task, showing that the 
      spatial component of the ordinal representation can be automatically activated.

TI  - Lateralization of cognitive processes in the brain.
PG  - 211-35
AB  - The lateralization of cognitive processes in the brain is discussed. The traditional 
      view of a language-visuo/spatial dichotomy of function between the hemispheres has 
      been replaced by more subtle distinctions. The use of magnetic resonance imaging 
      (MRI) to study brain morphology has resulted in a renewed focus on the relationship 
      between structural and functional asymmetry. Focus has been on the role played by 
      the planum temporale area in the posterior part of the superior temporal gyrus for 
      language asymmetry, and the possible significance of the larger left planum. The 
      dichotic listening technique is used to illustrate the difference between bottom-up, 
      or stimulus-driven laterality versus top-down, or instruction-driven laterality. It 
      is suggested that the hemispheric dominance observed at any time is the sum result 
      of the dynamic interaction between bottom-up and top-down processing tendencies. 
      Stimulus-driven laterality dominance is always monitored and modulated through 
      top-down cognitive processes, like shifting of attention and changes in arousal. A 
      model of top-down modulation of bottom-up laterality is presented with special 
      reference to the understanding of psychiatric disorders.

AB  - The Wada test is commonly used to evaluate language and memory lateralization in 
      candidates for epilepsy surgery. The spatial Brain Symmetry Index (BSI) quantifies 
      inter-hemispheric differences in the EEG. Its application has been shown to be 
      feasible during Wada testing. We developed a method for the quantification of EEG 
      asymmetry that matches visual assessments of the EEG better than BSI. Fifty-three 
      patients' EEG data, with a total of 85 injections were analyzed. In a step-wise, 
      data-driven manner, multiple electrode and frequency band combinations were 
      evaluated. Eventually, BSI, calculated using only the frontal electrodes F3 and F4, 
      was combined with a temporal measure of delta power in the central electrodes, C3 
      and C4, into a new measure: cBSI. Using the area under the ROC curve (AUC), we 
      showed that cBSI performs significantly better relative to BSI (median AUC 0.98 
      versus 0.96, p=0.0015, Wilcoxon signed rank test). Our results showed that asymmetry 
      detection was significantly improved by combining temporal with spatial qEEG 
      measures. In the future, our combined qEEG measure could allow for a more objective 
      way of monitoring EEG asymmetry, thereby increasing the feasibility of using EEG as 
      a monitoring tool during the Wada test. Future studies should, however, validate our 
      cBSI method in real time in the operating room or radiology suite.

TI  - Effects of simulated spectral holes on speech intelligibility and spatial release

LID - 10.1121/1.3273897 [doi]
AB  - The possibility that "dead regions" or "spectral holes" can account for some 
      differences in performance between bilateral cochlear implant (CI) users and 
      normal-hearing listeners was explored. Using a 20-band noise-excited vocoder to 
      simulate CI processing, this study examined effects of spectral holes on speech 
      reception thresholds (SRTs) and spatial release from masking (SRM) in difficult 
      listening conditions. Prior to processing, stimuli were convolved through 
      head-related transfer-functions to provide listeners with free-field directional 
      cues. Processed stimuli were presented over headphones under binaural or monaural 
      (right ear) conditions. Using Greenwood's [(1990). J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 87, 
      2592-2605] frequency-position function and assuming a cochlear length of 35 mm, 
      spectral holes were created for variable sizes (6 and 10 mm) and locations (base, 
      middle, and apex). Results show that middle-frequency spectral holes were the most 
      disruptive to SRTs, whereas high-frequency spectral holes were the most disruptive 
      to SRM. Spectral holes generally reduced binaural advantages in difficult listening 
      conditions. These results suggest the importance of measuring dead regions in CI 
      users. It is possible that customized programming for bilateral CI processors based 
      on knowledge about dead regions can enhance performance in adverse listening 
      situations.

TI  - Are there pre-existing neural, cognitive, or motoric markers for musical ability?
PG  - 124-34
AB  - Adult musician's brains show structural enlargements, but it is not known whether 
      these are inborn or a consequence of long-term training. In addition, music training 
      in childhood has been shown to have positive effects on visual-spatial and verbal 
      outcomes. However, it is not known whether pre-existing advantages in these skills 
      are found in children who choose to study a musical instrument nor is it known 
      whether there are pre-existing associations between music and any of these outcome 
      measures that could help explain the training effects. To answer these questions, we 
      compared 5- to 7-year-olds beginning piano or string lessons (n=39) with 5- to 
      7-year-olds not beginning instrumental training (n=31). All children received a 
      series of tests (visual-spatial, non-verbal reasoning, verbal, motor, and musical) 
      and underwent magnetic resonance imaging. We found no pre-existing neural, 
      cognitive, motor, or musical differences between groups and no correlations (after 
      correction for multiple analyses) between music perceptual skills and any brain or 
      visual-spatial measures. However, correlations were found between music perceptual 
      skills and both non-verbal reasoning and phonemic awareness. Such pre-existing 
      correlations suggest similarities in auditory and visual pattern recognition as well 
      a sharing of the neural substrates for language and music processing, most likely 
      due to innate abilities or implicit learning during early development. This baseline 
      study lays the groundwork for an ongoing longitudinal study addressing the effects 
      of intensive musical training on brain and cognitive development, and making it 
      possible to look retroactively at the brain and cognitive development of those 
      children who emerge showing exceptional musical talent.

TI  - The relationship of handedness to the cognitive, language, and visuo-spatial skills

PG  - 156-62
AB  - The relationship between hand preference, age, and developmental functioning was 
      examined in 70 autistic patients. Unilateral or mixed handedness appeared to be 
      stabilized by the age of five years. Patients with established hand lateralization 
      tended to function better in all developmental areas including intelligence, 
      language, and visuospatial abilities. It is a tenable hypothesis that the presence 
      or absence of hand lateralization by age five may be an important predictor of 
      outcome in autism.

TI  - A general valence asymmetry in similarity: Good is more alike than bad.
PG  - 1171-92
LID - 10.1037/xlm0000243 [doi]
AB  - The density hypothesis (Unkelbach, Fiedler, Bayer, Stegmüller, & Danner, 2008) 
      claims a general higher similarity of positive information to other positive 
      information compared with the similarity of negative information to other negative 
      information. This similarity asymmetry might explain valence asymmetries on all 
      levels of cognitive processing. The available empirical evidence for this general 
      valence asymmetry in similarity suffers from a lack of direct tests, low 
      representativeness, and possible confounding variables (e.g., differential valence 
      intensity, frequency, familiarity, or concreteness of positive and negative 
      stimuli). To address these problems, Study 1 first validated the spatial arrangement 
      method (SpAM) as a similarity measure. Using SpAM, Studies 2-6 found the proposed 
      valence asymmetry in large, representative samples of self- and other-generated 
      words (Studies 2a/2b), for words of consensual and idiosyncratic valence (Study 3), 
      for words from 1 and many independent information sources (Study 4), for real-life 
      experiences (Study 5), and for large data sets of verbal (i.e., ∼14,000 words 
      reported by Warriner, Kuperman, & Brysbaert, 2013) and visual information (i.e., 
      ∼1,000 pictures reported in the IAPS; Lang, Bradley, & Cuthbert, 2005; Study 6). 
      Together, these data support a general valence asymmetry in similarity, namely that 
      good is more alike than bad. (PsycINFO Database Record

TI  - Semantic dementia: clinical, radiological and pathological perspectives.
PG  - 409-22
AB  - Semantic dementia (SD) is a recently described clinical syndrome characterised by an 
      acquired progressive inability to name or comprehend common concepts, with little or 
      no distortion of the phonological and syntactic aspects of language, and relative 
      sparing of other aspects of cognition, such as episodic memory, nonverbal 
      problem-solving, and perceptual and visuo-spatial skills. The cognitive locus of 
      this syndrome appears to lie in the permanent store of long-term memory representing 
      general world knowledge-semantic memory. The anatomical distribution of atrophy is 
      less well-defined, and the contribution of various imaging modalities is discussed 
      in the context of a body of 45 published and unpublished cases. We conclude that 
      involvement of the left infero-lateral temporal cortex is the critical area in the 
      genesis of SD. SD probably always represents a non-Alzheimer neurodegenerative 
      process; a variety of pathological lesions may be present, and possible causes, 
      together with debates about their correct classification, are discussed.

AB  - Our objective was to study changes in EEG time-domain power spectral density (PSDt) 
      and localization of language areas during covert object naming tasks in human 
      subjects with epilepsy. EEG data for subjects with epilepsy were acquired during the 
      covert object naming tasks using a net of 256 electrodes. The trials required each 
      subject to provide the names of common objects presented every 4 seconds on slides. 
      Each trial comprised the 1.0 second before and 3.0 seconds after initial object 
      presentation. PSDt values at baseline and during tasks were calculated in the theta, 
      alpha, beta, low gamma, and high gamma bands. The spatial contour plots reveal that 
      PSDt values during object naming were 10-20% higher than the baseline values for 
      different bands. Language was lateralized to left frontal or temporal areas. In all 
      cases, the Wada test disclosed language lateralization to the left hemisphere as 
      well.

      behavioural and fMRI study.
PG  - 2896-903
LID - 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2011.06.016 [doi]
AB  - Magical ideation has been shown to be related to measures of hand preference, in 
      which those with mixed handedness exhibit higher levels of magical ideation than 
      those with either consistent left- or right-handedness. It is unclear whether the 
      relation between magical ideation and hand preference is the result of a bias in 
      questionnaire-taking behaviour or of some neuropsychological concomitant of cerebral 
      specialization. We sought to replicate this finding and further investigate how 
      magical ideation is related to other measures of laterality, including handedness 
      based on finger-tapping performance, and cerebral asymmetries for language, spatial 
      judgment, and face processing as revealed by fMRI. Creative achievement was also 
      assessed by questionnaire and correlated with magical ideation and the other 
      measures. Magical ideation and creativity were positively correlated, and both were 
      negatively correlated with absolute hand preference but not with hand performance or 
      with any of the cerebral asymmetries being assessed. The results do not support the 
      notion that the observed association between magical ideation, creativity and hand 
      preference has a neuropsychological explanation based on reduced cerebral 
      lateralization.

TI  - Virtual Cell modelling and simulation software environment.
PG  - 352-62

AB  - The Virtual Cell (VCell; http://vcell.org/) is a problem solving environment, built 
      on a central database, for analysis, modelling and simulation of cell biological 
      processes. VCell integrates a growing range of molecular mechanisms, including 
      reaction kinetics, diffusion, flow, membrane transport, lateral membrane diffusion 
      and electrophysiology, and can associate these with geometries derived from 
      experimental microscope images. It has been developed and deployed as a web-based, 
      distributed, client-server system, with more than a thousand world-wide users. VCell 
      provides a separation of layers (core technologies and abstractions) representing 
      biological models, physical mechanisms, geometry, mathematical models and numerical 
      methods. This separation clarifies the impact of modelling decisions, assumptions 
      and approximations. The result is a physically consistent, mathematically rigorous, 
      spatial modelling and simulation framework. Users create biological models and VCell 
      will automatically (i) generate the appropriate mathematical encoding for running a 
      simulation and (ii) generate and compile the appropriate computer code. Both 
      deterministic and stochastic algorithms are supported for describing and running 
      non-spatial simulations; a full partial differential equation solver using the 
      finite volume numerical algorithm is available for reaction-diffusion-advection 
      simulations in complex cell geometries including 3D geometries derived from 
      microscope images. Using the VCell database, models and model components can be 
      reused and updated, as well as privately shared among collaborating groups, or 
      published. Exchange of models with other tools is possible via import/export of 
      SBML, CellML and MatLab formats. Furthermore, curation of models is facilitated by 
      external database binding mechanisms for unique identification of components and by 
      standardised annotations compliant with the MIRIAM standard. VCell is now open 
      source, with its native model encoding language (VCML) being a public specification, 
      which stands as the basis for a new generation of more customised, 
      experiment-centric modelling tools using a new plug-in based platform.

AB  - In a study by Zwaan and Yaxley (2003, Cognition, 87, B79-B86), participants judged 
      the semantic relatedness of word pairs presented one above the other either in the 
      left or right visual field with all related pairs requiring right-handed responses. 
      If the vertical orientation of the word pairs matched their referents' typical 
      vertical orientation ("roof" above "basement") a match effect was observed, but only 
      when the word pair was presented in the left visual field. We replicated this study 
      with response side as an additional factor and found a main effect of match, as well 
      as a Simon effect with faster responses when the required response matched the 
      visual field in which the word pair was presented. We did not, however, observe an 
      interaction between the match effect and the visual field. This challenges the 
      assumption that coarse semantic representations, including spatial properties of 
      objects, are mainly processed in the right hemisphere.

TI  - Letters as spatial-oriented shapes and/or graphemic signs: a developmental study of 
      left- and right-handed girls during the period of learning to read.
PG  - 385-99
AB  - This study is concerned with the problem of hemispheric specialization and/or 
      cooperation in relation to development and manual laterality. The processing of 
      alphabetic signs and its relationship to interhemispheric transfer and functional 
      hemispheric asymmetries were studied by comparing left- and right-handed girls 
      during acquisition of reading. The children perform matching tasks with letters 
      having different orientations and with meaningless forms having the same 
      orientations as the letters. Each subject performed the matching under three 
      conditions: right/left intermanual transfer, left/right intermanual transfer, and 
      dichaptic exploration. Results indicate: (1) A differentiated development between 
      the two handednesses. (2) The functional lateralization change was different for 
      left- and right-handed girls, a greater effect of the ability to identify the letter 
      on matching tasks was observed for the right-handed children than for the 
      left-handed children. These last results are discussed with regard to 
      inter-hemispheric transfer and functional hemispheric asymmetry changes. We 
      hypothesized a strategy difference between left- and right-handed girls and a 
      difference in their ability to change their cognitive strategy (left-handers 
      continue to favor a spatial coding with letters).

AB  - Brain-damaged patients with right-sided unilateral spatial neglect (USN) often make 
      left-sided errors in reading single words or pseudowords (neglect dyslexia, ND). We 
      propose that both left neglect and low fixation accuracy account for reading errors 
      in neglect dyslexia. Eye movements were recorded in USN patients with (ND+) and 
      without (ND-) neglect dyslexia and in a matched control group of right brain-damaged 
      patients without neglect (USN-). Unlike ND- and controls, ND+ patients showed left 
      lateralized omission errors and a distorted eye movement pattern in both a reading 
      aloud task and a non-verbal saccadic task. During reading, the total number of 
      fixations was larger in these patients independent of visual hemispace, and most 
      fixations were inaccurate. Similarly, in the saccadic task only ND+ patients were 
      unable to reach the moving dot. A third experiment addressed the nature of the left 
      lateralization in reading error distribution by simulating neglect dyslexia in ND- 
      patients. ND- and USN- patients had to perform a speeded reading-at-threshold task 
      that did not allow for eye movements. When stimulus exploration was prevented, ND- 
      patients, but not controls, produced a pattern of errors similar to that of ND+ with 
      unlimited exposure time (e.g., left-sided errors). We conclude that neglect dyslexia 
      reading errors may arise in USN patients as a consequence of an additional and 
      independent deficit unrelated to the orthographic material. In particular, the 
      presence of an altered oculo-motor pattern, preventing the automatic execution of 
      the fine saccadic eye movements involved in reading, uncovers, in USN patients, the 
      attentional bias also in reading single centrally presented words.

TI  - Functional MRI localization of language in a 9-year-old child.
PG  - 213-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Localizing critical brain functions such as language in children is 
      difficult and generally requires invasive techniques. Recently sensory, motor and 
      language functions in adults have been mapped to specific brain locations using 
      functional imaging techniques. Of these techniques, functional MRI (fMRI) is the 
      least invasive and has the highest spatial and temporal resolution. Its use in 
      adults is well documented but application to children has not been as well 
      described. In the present study lateralization and localization of language was 
      evaluated with fMRI prior to epilepsy surgery in a nine-year-old male with complex 
      partial seizures, attentional difficulty and decreased verbal proficiency. METHODS: 
      Two language paradigms well studied in adults (read, verb generation) and two 
      additional language paradigms (antonym generation, latter fluency) were studied 
      using whole brain fMRI after stimulus items and timing were adjusted to achieve the 
      desired performance level during imaging. The patient was also conditioned to the 
      magnet environment prior to imaging. RESULTS: Word reading and letter fluency tasks 
      produced lateralized and localized activation similar to that seen in adults. The 
      patient had no language deficits following an anterior 2/3 dominant temporal lobe 
      resection. CONCLUSIONS: With modifications of protocols such as those detailed in 
      this report, this non-invasive method for localizing language function is feasible 
      for the presurgical evaluation of children as well being applicable for a variety of 
      developmental language issues.

TI  - Symbolic representations in motor sequence learning.
PG  - 417-26
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.08.019 [doi]
AB  - It has been shown that varying the spatial versus symbolic nature of stimulus 
      presentation and response production, which affects stimulus-response (S-R) mapping 
      requirements, influences the magnitude of implicit sequence learning (Koch and 
      Hoffman, 2000). Here, we evaluated how spatial and symbolic stimuli and responses 
      affect the neural bases of sequence learning. We selectively eliminated the spatial 
      component of stimulus presentation (spatial vs. symbolic), response execution 
      (manual vs. vocal), or both. Fourteen participants performed the alternating serial 
      reaction time task under these conditions in an MRI scanner, with interleaved 
      acquisition to allow for recording of vocal response reaction times. Nine regions of 
      interest (ROIs) were selected to test the hypothesis that the dorsolateral 
      prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) was preferentially engaged for spatially cued conditions 
      and cerebellum lobule HVI, crus I and II were associated with symbolically cued 
      learning. We found that the left cerebellum lobule HVI was selectively recruited for 
      symbolic learning and the percent signal change in this region was correlated with 
      learning magnitude under the symbolic conditions. In contrast, the DLPFC did not 
      exhibit selective activation for learning under spatial conditions. The inferior 
      parietal lobule exhibited increased activation during learning regardless of the 
      condition, supporting its role in forming an abstract representation of learned 
      sequences. These findings reveal different brain networks that are flexibly engaged 
      depending on the conditions of sequence learning.

AB  - Attention plays a fundamental role in selectively processing stimuli in our 
      environment despite distraction. Spatial attention induces increasing and decreasing 
      power of neural alpha oscillations (8-12 Hz) in brain regions ipsilateral and 
      contralateral to the locus of attention, respectively. This study tested whether the 
      hemispheric lateralization of alpha power codes not just the spatial location but 
      also the temporal structure of the stimulus. Participants attended to spoken digits 
      presented to one ear and ignored tightly synchronized distracting digits presented 
      to the other ear. In the magnetoencephalogram, spatial attention induced 
      lateralization of alpha power in parietal, but notably also in auditory cortical 
      regions. This alpha power lateralization was not maintained steadily but fluctuated 
      in synchrony with the speech rate and lagged the time course of low-frequency (1-5 
      Hz) sensory synchronization. Higher amplitude of alpha power modulation at the 
      speech rate was predictive of a listener's enhanced performance of stream-specific 
      speech comprehension. Our findings demonstrate that alpha power lateralization is 
      modulated in tune with the sensory input and acts as a spatiotemporal filter 
      controlling the read-out of sensory content.

      paragraph reading.

AB  - Cancellation tasks and line bisection tasks are commonly used to diagnose spatial 
      neglect after right hemisphere lesions. In such tasks, neglect patients often show 
      leftsided omissions of targets in cancellation tests as well as a pathological 
      rightward deviation in horizontal line bisection. However, double dissociations have 
      also been reported and the relation between performance in both tasks is not clear. 
      Another impairment frequently associated with the neglect syndrome are omissions or 
      misread initial letters of single words, a phenomenon termed neglect dyslexia (ND). 
      Omissions of whole words on the contralesional side of the page are generally 
      considered as egocentric or space-based errors, whereas misreadings of the left part 
      of a word in ND can be viewed as a type of stimulus-centered or word-based, 
      perceptual error. As words, sentences and horizontal lines have a similar spatial 
      layout in the sense that they all are horizontally aligned, long stimuli with a 
      canonical left-right orientation (with a defined beginning on the left and an end on 
      the right side), we hypothesized a significant association between the horizontal 
      line bisection error (LBE) in neglect and the extent (number) of neglected or 
      substituted letters within single words in ND (neglect dyslexia extension, NDE). To 
      this purpose, we computed Center-of-Cancellation (CoC) scores in a cancellation task 
      as well as Center-of-Reading (CoR) scores in an experimental paragraph reading test. 
      We found that the CoR was a better indicator for egocentric word omissions than the 
      CoC in a group of 17 patients with left visuospatial neglect. Furthermore, the LBE 
      predicted the severity of ND, indicated by highly significant correlations between 
      the LBE and the extent of the neglected letter string within single words (NDE; 
      r=0.73, p<0.001) as well as between the LBE and the frequency of ND errors (r=0.61; 
      p=0.009). In contrast, we found no significant correlation between the CoC and the 
      severity of ND. These results indicate two different pathological mechanisms being 
      responsible for contralesional spatial neglect and ND. In conclusion, the LBE is a 
      more sensitive predictor of the presence and severity of the reading disorder in 
      spatial neglect than conventional cancellation tasks.

AB  - To investigate spatial responses by aphasic patients during language tasks, 63 
      aphasics (21 severe, 21 moderate, and 21 mild) were administered two kinds of 
      auditory pointing tasks-word tasks and sentence tasks-in which the spatial 
      conditions of the stimuli were controlled. There were significantly fewer correct 
      responses on the right side of a space than on the left side in both the word and 
      sentence tasks, but the left deviation of correct responses was more prominent in 
      the sentence task than in the word task. Additionally, the severe aphasics exhibited 
      a prominent leftward deviation that may have been the result of deficits in 
      rightward attention controlled by the left hemisphere. This phenomenon also seems to 
      reflect the directional attention that is subserved by the right hemisphere, which 
      attends to the left side of a space and, less predominantly, the right side of a 
      space.

LID - 10.1089/brain.2014.0263 [doi]
AB  - The presupplementary motor area (pre-SMA) is involved in volitional selection. 
      Despite the lateralization of the language network and different functions for both 
      pre-SMA, few studies have reported the lateralization of pre-SMA activity and very 
      little is known about the possible lateralization of pre-SMA connectivity. Via 
      functional connectivity analysis, we sought to understand how the language network 
      may be connected to other intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) through the 
      pre-SMA. We performed a spatial independent component analysis of resting state 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging in 30 volunteers to identify the language 
      network. Subsequently, we applied seed-to-voxel functional connectivity analyses 
      centered on peaks detected in the pre-SMA. Three signal peaks were detected in the 
      pre-SMA. The left rostral pre-SMA intrinsic connectivity network (LR ICN) was left 
      lateralized in contrast to bilateral ICNs associated to right pre-SMA peaks. The LR 
      ICN was anticorrelated with the dorsal attention network and the right caudal 
      pre-SMA ICN (RC ICN) anticorrelated with the default mode network. These two ICNs 
      overlapped minimally. In contrast, the right rostral ICN overlapped the LR ICN. Both 
      right ICNs overlapped in the ventral attention network (vATT). The bilateral 
      connectivity of the right rostral pre-SMA may allow right hemispheric recruitment to 
      process semantic ambiguities. Overlap between the right pre-SMA ICNs in vATT may 
      contribute to internal thought to external environment reorientation. Distinct ICNs 
      connected to areas involved in lexico-syntactic selection and phonology converge in 
      the pre-SMA, which may constitute the resolution space of competing condition-action 
      associations for speech production.

PG  - 49-59
AB  - Twenty-one patients with right hemisphere damage were studied (11 men, 10 women; 
      average age = 41.33; range = 19-65). Patients were divided in two groups: 
      pre-Rolandic (six patients) and retro-Rolandic (15 patients) right hemisphere 
      damage. A special reading test was given to each patient. The observed errors 
      included: literal errors (substitutions, additions, and omissions of letters), 
      substitutions of syllables and pseudowords for meaningful words, left hemispatial 
      neglect, confabulation, splitting of words, verbal errors (substitutions, additions, 
      and omission of words), grouping of letters belonging to two different words, misuse 
      of punctuation marks, and errors in following lines. It was proposed that spatial 
      alexia is characterized by: (1) some difficulties in the recognition of the spatial 
      orientation in letters; (2) left hemispatial neglect; (3) tendency to "complete" the 
      sense of words and sentences; (4) inability to follow lines when reading texts, and 
      sequentially explore the spatial distribution of the written material; and (5) 
      grouping and fragmentation of words, most likely as a consequence of the inability 
      to interpret the relative value of spaces between letters correctly.

AB  - Functional hemispheric asymmetries of speech production and perception are a key 
      feature of the human language system, but their neurophysiological basis is still 
      poorly understood. Using a combined fMRI and tract-based spatial statistics 
      approach, we investigated the relation of microstructural asymmetries in 
      language-relevant white matter pathways and functional activation asymmetries during 
      silent verb generation and passive listening to spoken words. Tract-based spatial 
      statistics revealed several leftward asymmetric clusters in the arcuate fasciculus 
      and uncinate fasciculus that were differentially related to activation asymmetries 
      in the two functional tasks. Frontal and temporal activation asymmetries during 
      silent verb generation were positively related to the strength of specific 
      microstructural white matter asymmetries in the arcuate fasciculus. In contrast, 
      microstructural uncinate fasciculus asymmetries were related to temporal activation 
      asymmetries during passive listening. These findings suggest that white matter 
      asymmetries may indeed be one of the factors underlying functional hemispheric 
      asymmetries. Moreover, they also show that specific localized white matter 
      asymmetries might be of greater relevance for functional activation asymmetries than 
      microstructural features of whole pathways.

TI  - Effects of attention on dichotic listening in elderly and patients with dementia of 
      the Alzheimer type.
PG  - 286-93

AB  - This article presents an overview of our studies in elderly and Alzheimer patients 
      employing Kimura's dichotic digits paradigm as a measure for left hemispheric 
      predominance for processing language stimuli. In addition to structural brain 
      mechanisms, we demonstrated that attention modulates the direction and degree of ear 
      asymmetry in dichotic listening. Elderly showed increasingly more difficulties 
      focusing attention on the left ear (LE) with advancing age. Alzheimer patients 
      showed severe deficits to allocate attention to the LE, which could result in a 
      right ear advantage. These results may be attributed to a breakdown of the cortical 
      attentional network which is mediated by frontal (inhibitory control of attention) 
      and parietal regions (spatial attention and 'disengagement processes'). Both 
      interhemispheric disconnectivity (callosal atrophy) and intrahemispheric 
      disconnectivity (subcortical white matter lesions) appear to be important factors 
      contributing to these findings.

AB  - Unilateral spatial neglect is a disabling condition, frequently observed after 
      right-hemisphere damage (RHD), and associated with poor functional recovery. 
      Clinical and experimental evidence indicates that attentional impairments are 
      prominent in neglect. Recent brain imaging and behavioral studies in neglect 
      patients and healthy individuals have provided insights into the mechanisms of 
      attention and have revealed interactions between putative attentional networks. We 
      recruited 16 RHD patients and 16 neurologically intact observers to perform a 
      lateralized version of the Attention Network Test devised by Posner and co-workers 
      (Fan et al., 2002). The results showed evidence of interaction between attentional 
      networks during conflict resolution. Phasic alertness improved the orienting deficit 
      to left-sided targets, reducing the interference of distracters in the neglected 
      visual field, thus facilitating conflict resolution in the majority of patients. 
      Modulating alertness may be an important way of improving basic deficits associated 
      with neglect, such as those affecting spatial orienting.

TI  - The Ventral Anterior Temporal Lobe has a Necessary Role in Exception Word Reading.
PG  - 3035-3045
LID - 10.1093/cercor/bhy131 [doi]
AB  - An influential account of reading holds that words with exceptional 
      spelling-to-sound correspondences (e.g., PINT) are read via activation of their 
      lexical-semantic representations, supported by the anterior temporal lobe (ATL). 
      This account has been inconclusive because it is based on neuropsychological 
      evidence, in which lesion-deficit relationships are difficult to localize precisely, 
      and functional neuroimaging data, which is spatially precise but cannot demonstrate 
      whether the ATL activity is necessary for exception word reading. To address these 
      issues, we used a technique with good spatial specificity-repetitive transcranial 
      magnetic stimulation (rTMS)-to demonstrate a necessary role of ATL in exception word 
      reading. Following rTMS to left ventral ATL, healthy Japanese adults made more 
      regularization errors in reading Japanese exception words. We successfully simulated 
      these results in a computational model in which exception word reading was 
      underpinned by semantic activations. The ATL is critically and selectively involved 
      in reading exception words.

TI  - Time perception in spatial neglect: a distorted representation?
PG  - 193-200
LID - 10.1037/a0021304 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: It has been proposed that time, space, and numbers share the same metrics 
      and cortical network, the right parietal cortex. Several recent investigations have 
      demonstrated that the mental number line representation is distorted in neglect 
      patients. The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between time and 
      spatial configuration in neglect patients. METHOD: Fourteen right-brain damaged 
      patients (six with neglect and eight without neglect), as well as eight age-matched 
      healthy controls, performed a time discrimination task. A standard tone (short: 700 
      ms and long: 1,700 ms) had to be confronted in duration to a test tone. Test tone 
      differed of 100, 200, and 300 ms respect to the standard tone duration. RESULTS: 
      Neglect patients performed significantly worse than patients without neglect and 
      healthy controls, irrespective of the duration of the standard tone. CONCLUSION: 
      These results support the hypothesis that mental representations of space and time 
      both share, to some extent, a common cortical network. Besides, spatial neglect 
      seems to distort the time representation, inducing an overestimation of time 
      durations.

TI  - Assessment of neglect dyslexia with functional reading materials.
PG  - 75-86
LID - 10.1310/tsr2101-75 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spatial neglect is a neurocognitive disorder that affects perception, 
      representation, and/or motor planning. Neglect dyslexia in spatial neglect after 
      right hemisphere damage may co-occur with, or be dissociated from, other spatial 
      neglect signs. Previous neglect dyslexia research focused on word-level stimuli and 
      reading errors. Using single words for assessment may leave some people with neglect 
      dyslexia undiagnosed, and assessment materials that are closer to texts read in real 
      life may better capture neglect dyslexia. METHOD: The authors tested reading in 67 
      right hemisphere stroke survivors with 4 types of text materials: words, phrases, an 
      article, and a menu. RESULTS: Accuracy on reading the menu and article texts was 
      significantly poorer than reading the words and phrases. The hypothesis that 
      assessment materials with ecological validity such as reading a menu and reading an 
      article may be more challenging than reading single words and phrases was supported. 
      CONCLUSION: Results suggest that neglect dyslexia assessment after stroke should 
      include text materials comparable to those read in everyday life. Increasing the 
      spatial extent of training materials in future research might also yield better 
      functional generalization after right brain stroke.

TI  - Relation of spatial reasoning ability to hand performance in male and female 
      left-handers to familial sinistrality and writing hand.
PG  - 143-55
AB  - The relation of mental ability for spatial reasoning to hand performance was studied 
      in male and female left-handers considering familial sinistrality and writing hand. 
      Hand performance was assessed by a dot-filling test; hand preference was assessed by 
      the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (Geschwind scores). Nonverbal intelligence 
      (spatial reasoning) was measured by the Cattell's Culture Fair Intelligence Test. 
      The relationship between IQ and hand performance was found to be more complicated 
      than expected. This was associated with sex, familial sinistrality, and writing 
      hand, which created different patterns in interactions between motor and cognitive 
      systems. It was concluded that the brain benefits from different strategies by using 
      both hemispheres in a competitive and complementary manner where necessary to 
      achieve a high visual-spatial performance depending upon genetic preprograms.

TI  - An anthropological perspective on the evolution and lateralization of the brain.
PG  - 424-47
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to review the anthropological evidence relating to the 
      cultural determinants of the right-hand first postaulted by Hertz in his classic 
      study. Also a genetic/cultural conformity model of handedness is presented that 
      postulates that the incidence of handedness in a society is held to result both from 
      the genetic expression of handedness interacting with cultural pressures towards 
      conformity. The evolutionary basis for the hemispheric functional organization into 
      cognitive and perceptual hemispheric functions is discussed in terms of 
      "right-handed dominant homozygotes, DD," "heterozygotes, DR," mixed-handers, and 
      "left-handed recessive homozygotes, RR." The cross-cultural distribution of 
      handedness provides support for this model since the more conforming 
      agriculturalists as measured by the Asch Test have a significantly lower incidence 
      of left-handedness (0.59%, 1.5% and 3.4%), while the more permissively socialized 
      Eskimo and Arunta hunters, who are seen to be more independent on the Asch Test, 
      have 11.3% and 10.5% left-handers, respectively. Also, due to the greater pressures 
      for females to conform in agricultural societies, the incidence of female 
      left-handedness in agricultural societies is 0% out of 330 female Ss, with 3.8%, 
      0.79%, and 2.5% in agricultural males, as contrasted with the Eskimo hunters who 
      have 12.5% left-handed males and 10.3% left-handed females, showing no significant 
      sex difference. A further Hong Kong-English study also supports the genetic/cultural 
      conformity model with a significantly lower incidence of Hong Kong Chinese 
      left-handers (RR: male = 2.7%, and female = 4.2%). The next section, concerned with 
      the neonatal sex-hormone differentiation and lateralization processes, provides a 
      neuropsychologic theory relating to spatial and linguistic skills that is relevant 
      to the following section, which deals with relationships between laterality and 
      cognitive style. The results are also presented for the Alaskan Eskimo in relation 
      to hand, eye, auditory dominance and cognitive style. The analysis of Eskimo 
      fixed-versus mixed-laterality data also confirms, as predicted, that both within and 
      across a modality (e.g., right hand/right eye/right ear) fixed right-dominance 
      Eskimo Ss are more field-independent than mixed-dominance Ss, while the fixed 
      left-dominance Ss are the most field-dependent and have lower spatial skills. The 
      discussion section reviews the papers relating to the genetic/conformity model of 
      handedness, as well as laterality and cognitive style. The evolutionary adaptive 
      significance of sex differences in gonadal differentiation and lateralization of the 
      brain on spatial and linguistic skills are also reviewed. The conclusions are 
      concerned with the implications for biosocial theory and the rapidly changing 
      incidence of left-handedness due to accompanying changes in cultural pressures both 
      within and across cultures.

AB  - Recent concepts of cerebral visual processing predict from overlapping patterns of 
      face and word activation in cortex that left fusiform lesions will not only cause 
      pure alexia but also lead to mild impairments of face processing. Our goal was to 
      determine if alexic subjects had deficits in facial identity processing similar to 
      those seen after right fusiform lesions, or complementary deficits affecting 
      different aspects of face processing. We studied four alexic patients whose lesions 
      involved the left fusiform gyrus and one prosopagnosic subject with a right fusiform 
      lesion, on standard tests of face perception and recognition. We evaluated their 
      ability first to process faces in linear contour images, and second to detect, 
      discriminate, identify and integrate facial speech patterns into perception. We 
      found that all five patients were impaired in face matching across viewpoint, but 
      the alexic subjects performed worse with line-drawn faces, while the prosopagnosic 
      subject did not. Alexic subjects could detect facial speech patterns but had trouble 
      identifying them and did not integrate facial speech patterns with speech sounds, 
      whereas identification and integration was intact in the prosopagnosic subject. We 
      conclude that, in addition to their role in reading, the left-sided regions damaged 
      in alexic subjects participate in the perception of facial identity but in a 
      non-redundant fashion, focusing on the information in linear contours at higher 
      spatial frequencies. In addition they have a dominant role in processing facial 
      speech patterns, another visual aspect of language processing.

AB  - The initial stages of reading are characterised by parallel and effortless access to 
      letters constituting a word. Neglect dyslexia is an acquired reading disorder 
      characterised by omission or substitution of the initial or the final letters of 
      words. Rarely, the disorder appears in a'pure' form that is, without other signs of 
      spatial neglect. Neglect dyslexia is linked to damage involving the inferior 
      parietal lobe and regions of the temporal lobe, but the precise anatomical basis of 
      the pure form of the disorder is unknown. Here, we show that pure neglect dyslexia 
      is associated with decreased structural connectivity between the inferior parietal 
      and lateral temporal lobe. We examined patient DM, who following bilateral 
      occipito-parietal damage presented left neglect dyslexia together with right visual 
      field loss, but no signs of spatial neglect. DM's reading errors were affected by 
      word length and were much more frequent for pseudowords than for existing words. 
      Most errors were omissions or substitutions of the first or second letter, and the 
      spatial distribution of errors was similar for stimuli presented left or right of 
      fixation. The brain lesions of DM comprised the inferior and superior parietal 
      lobule as well as the cuneus and precuneus of the left hemisphere, and the angular 
      gyrus and lateral occipital cortex of the right hemisphere. Diffusion tensor imaging 
      revealed bilateral decrease of fibre tracts connecting the inferior parietal lobule 
      with the superior and middle temporal cortex. These findings suggest that 
      parieto-temporal connections play a significant role for the deployment of attention 
      within words during reading.

AB  - Whether or not the hippocampus participates in semantic memory retrieval has been 
      the focus of much debate in the literature. However, few neuroimaging studies have 
      directly compared hippocampal activation during semantic and episodic retrieval 
      tasks that are well matched in all respects other than the source of the retrieved 
      information. In Experiment 1, we compared hippocampal fMRI activation during a 
      classic semantic memory task, category production, and an episodic version of the 
      same task, category cued recall. Left hippocampal activation was observed in both 
      episodic and semantic conditions, although other regions of the brain clearly 
      distinguished the two tasks. Interestingly, participants reported using retrieval 
      strategies during the semantic retrieval task that relied on autobiographical and 
      spatial information; for example, visualizing themselves in their kitchen while 
      producing items for the category kitchen utensils. In Experiment 2, we considered 
      whether the use of these spatial and autobiographical retrieval strategies could 
      have accounted for the hippocampal activation observed in Experiment 1. Categories 
      were presented that elicited one of three retrieval strategy types, autobiographical 
      and spatial, autobiographical and nonspatial, and neither autobiographical nor 
      spatial. Once again, similar hippocampal activation was observed for all three 
      category types, regardless of the inclusion of spatial or autobiographical content. 
      We conclude that the distinction between semantic and episodic memory is more 
      complex than classic memory models suggest.

AB  - Increasing efforts have been denoted to elucidating the effective connectivity (EC) 
      among brain regions recruited by certain language task; however, it remains unclear 
      the impact of handedness on the EC network underlying language processing. In 
      particularly, this has not been investigated in Chinese language, which shows 
      several differences from alphabetic language. This study thereby explored the 
      functional activity patterns and the EC network during a Chinese semantic task based 
      on functional MRI data of healthy left handers (LH) and right handers (RH). We found 
      that RH presented a left lateralized activity pattern in cerebral cortex and a right 
      lateralized pattern in cerebellum; while LH were less lateralized than RH in both 
      cerebral and cerebellar areas. The conditional Granger causality method in 
      deconvolved BOLD level further demonstrated more interhemispheric directional 
      connections in LH than RH group, suggesting better bihemispheric coordination and 
      increased interhemispheric communication in LH. Furthermore, we found significantly 
      increased EC from right middle occipital gyrus to bilateral insula (INS) while 
      decreased EC from left INS to left precentral gyrus in LH group comparing to RH 
      group, implying that handedness may differentiate the causal relationship of 
      information processing in integration of visual-spatial analysis and semantic word 
      retrieval of Chinese characters.

AB  - The relation of mental ability for spatial reasoning (Cattell's Culture Fair 
      Intelligence Test) to hand skill assessed by peg-moving task was studied in normal 
      left-handers. Nonlinear, quadratic relationships were established between these two 
      parameters exhibiting different characteristics according to sex and writing hand. 
      It was concluded that the contributions of the right and left cerebral hemispheres 
      to the cognitive-motor output of the brain depend on sex and writing hand as well as 
      the degree of left-handedness in left-handers.

TI  - Priming the mental time-line: effects of modality and processing mode.
PG  - 231-44
LID - 10.1007/s10339-013-0537-5 [doi]
AB  - The notion of a mental time-line (i.e., past corresponds to left and future 
      corresponds to right) supports the conceptual metaphor view assuming that abstract 
      concepts like "time" are grounded in cognitively more accessible concepts like 
      "space." In five experiments, we further investigated the relationship between 
      temporal and spatial representations and examined whether or not the spatial 
      correspondents of time are unintentionally activated. We employed a priming 
      paradigm, in which visual or auditory prime words (i.e., temporal adverbs such as 
      yesterday, tomorrow) preceded a colored square. In all experiments, participants 
      discriminated the color of this square by responding with the left or the right 
      hand. Although the temporal reference of the priming adverb was task irrelevant in 
      Experiment 1, visually presented primes facilitated responses to the square in 
      correspondence with the direction of the mental time-line. This priming effect was 
      absent in Experiments 2, 3, and 5, in which the primes were presented auditorily and 
      the temporal reference of the words could be ignored. The effect, however, emerged 
      when attention was oriented to the temporal content of the auditory prime words in 
      Experiment 4. The results suggest that task demands differentially modulate the 
      activation of the mental time-line within the visual and auditory modality and 
      support a flexible association between conceptual codes.

AB  - To test the role of gestures in the origin of language, we studied hand preferences 
      for grasping or pointing to objects at several spatial positions in human infants 
      and adult baboons. If the roots of language are indeed in gestural communication, we 
      expect that human infants and baboons will present a comparable difference in their 
      pattern of laterality according to task: both should be more 
      right-hand/left-hemisphere specialized when communicating by pointing than when 
      simply grasping objects. Our study is the first to test both human infants and 
      baboons on the same communicative task. Our results show remarkable convergence in 
      the distribution of the two species' hand biases on the two kinds of tasks: In both 
      human infants and baboons, right-hand preference was significantly stronger for the 
      communicative task than for grasping objects. Our findings support the hypothesis 
      that left-lateralized language may be derived from a gestural communication system 
      that was present in the common ancestor of baboons and humans.
